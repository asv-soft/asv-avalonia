# 👋 Welcome to Asv.Avalonia

## Introduction

**Asv.Avalonia** is a lightweight toolkit for building cross-platform applications
with [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).
It provides ready-to-use controls, utility systems (shortcut manager with undo/redo, layout persistence, theming
helpers, and more), as well as an example application that demonstrates real usage patterns.

## Quick start

Here are a few ways to begin:

- Follow the [Get Started guide](install.md) to build your first small app.
- Look at the [example application](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-avalonia/tree/main/src/Asv.Avalonia.Example) to see
  real usage.
- Explore the rest of the documentation at your own pace.

## Used in Production

Asv.Avalonia is used in the [Asv.Drones](https://github.com/asv-soft/asv-drones) application — a cross-platform ground
control station.
This is a real production example of the library in action!
